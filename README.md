## Project Description: 

- Title: Airport App
- Task: Implement a graph ADT for a practical application related to airport data.
- Input: Two files - airports.csv (containing airport information) and distances.csv (containing connection data).
- Output: Menu-driven system allowing users to interact with airport data, including retrieving airport information and finding connections between airports.
- Implementation: Use Java Digraph class to store airport and distance information. Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest distances between airports.
- Required I/O: Provide options for querying airport information, finding minimum distances between airports, and exiting the program.
